## Examples

### Check firewalls are present

```ruby
describe azure_firewalls do
  it            { should exist }
  its('names')  { should include 'test-firewall' }
end
```
### Filter the results to include only those with names match the given string value

```ruby
describe azure_firewalls.where{ name.eql?('production-firewall-01') } do
  it { should exist }
end
```
## Matchers

This InSpec audit resource has the following special matchers. For a full list of available matchers, please visit our [Universal Matchers page](https://www.inspec.io/docs/reference/matchers/).

### exists

The control will pass if the filter returns at least one result.

```ruby
# If we expect 'ExampleGroup' Resource Group to have Firewalls
describe azure_firewalls(resource_group: 'ExampleGroup') do
  it { should exist }
end
```

Use `should_not` if you expect zero matches.

```ruby
# If we expect 'EmptyExampleGroup' Resource Group to not have Firewalls
describe azure_firewalls(resource_group: 'EmptyExampleGroup') do
  it { should_not exist }
end
```
## Azure Permissions

Your [Service Principal](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/azure-resource-manager/resource-group-create-service-principal-portal) must be setup with a `contributor` role on the subscription you wish to test.
