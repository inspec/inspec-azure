Unless defined, `azure_cloud` global endpoint, and default values for the http client will be used.

## Examples

### Check a Specific SQL Server is Present
```ruby
describe azure_sql_servers do
  its('names')  { should include 'my-server-name' }
end
```
### Filters the Results to Include Only Those Servers which Include the Given Name (Client Side Filtering)
```ruby
describe azure_sql_servers.where{ name.include?('production') } do
  it { should exist }
end
```
## Filters the Results to Include Only Those Servers which Reside in a Given Location (Client Side Filtering)
```ruby
describe azure_sql_servers.where{ location.eql?('westeurope') } do
  it { should exist }
end
```    
## Filters the Results to Include Only Those Servers which Reside in a Given Location and Include the Given Name (Server Side Filtering - Recommended)
```ruby
describe azure_generic_resources(resource_provider: 'Microsoft.Sql/servers', substring_of_name: 'production', location: 'westeurope') do
  it {should exist}  
end
```
## Matchers

This InSpec audit resource has the following special matchers. For a full list of available matchers, please visit our [Universal Matchers page](https://www.inspec.io/docs/reference/matchers/).

  it { should exist }
end
```
## Azure Permissions
