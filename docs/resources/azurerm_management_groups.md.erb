# azurerm\_management\_groups

Use the `azurerm_management_groups` InSpec audit resource to test properties related to
management groups.

<br />

## Azure REST API version

This resource interacts with version `2018-03-01-preview` of the Azure
Management API. For more information see the [official Azure documentation](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/rest/api/resources/managementgroups/list).

At the moment, there doesn't appear to be a way to select the version of the
Azure API docs. If you notice a newer version being referenced in the official
documentation please open an issue or submit a pull request using the updated
version.

## Availability

### Installation

This resource is available in the `inspec-azure` [resource
pack](https://www.inspec.io/docs/reference/glossary/#resource-pack). To use it,
add the following to your `inspec.yml` in your top-level profile:

    depends:
      - name: inspec-azure
        git: https://github.com/inspec/inspec-azure.git

You'll also need to setup your Azure credentials; see the resource pack
[README](https://github.com/inspec/inspec-azure#inspec-for-azure).

## Parameters

N/A

## Attributes

  - `group_ids`
  - `group_types`
  - `group_names`
  - `group_tenant_ids`
  - `group_display_names`

### group_ids

The management group ids.

### group_types

The management group types.

### group_names

The management group names.

### group_tenant_ids

The management group tenant ids.

### group_display_names

The management group display names.

### Other Attributes

There are additional attributes that may be accessed that we have not
documented. Please take a look at the [Azure documentation](#-Azure-REST-API-version).
Any attribute in the response may be accessed with the key names separated by
dots (`.`).

The API may not always return keys that do not have any associated data. There
may be cases where the deeply nested property may not have the desired
attribute along your call chain. If you find yourself writing tests against
properties that may be nil, fork this resource pack and add an accessor to the
resource. Within that accessor you'll be able to guard against nil keys. Pull
requests are always welcome.
